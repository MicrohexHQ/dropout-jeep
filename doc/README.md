# documentation

Design docs and other notes here.

## data storage

Figure something out. Secondary indexes a must.


## required services

- recurring payments processor (Stripe? Recurly?)
- email api (I like Mailgun)
- no SMS requirements unless I choose that for 2-factor auth, in which case Twilio
