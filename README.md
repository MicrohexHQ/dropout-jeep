# dropout-jeep

Grown-up conversations about computers, programming, and software engineering, moderated when necessary. Inspired by every place I've had a good conversation online, from The WELL to Metafilter.

Many thanks to [the NSA](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-12-30/how-nsa-hacks-your-iphone-presenting-dropout-jeep) for the awesome name. My tax dollars got me something nice!
